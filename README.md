# RazerDCHotkey
Minimal web API that gets my current mute status in Discord from my [Discord bot](https://github.com/steindlj/okidoki). To color the mute hotkey appropriately, the [Razer Chroma SDK](https://github.com/razerofficial/CSharp_SampleApp) was used. (not muted -> ðŸŸ© | muted -> ðŸŸ¥)
>Only works if the bot is on the same server as me.
